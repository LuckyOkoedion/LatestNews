That was only 18% down on its previous weekend score and lifted its running total since release on Dec. 15, 2021, to $60.3 million. It also kept a substantial lead over its rivals, with a 28% market share, ahead of “Sing 2” in second place with a score of $863,000 and a market share of 20%. The aggregate nationwide box office for the weekend, however, fell deeper into the doldrums. It slipped from $5.99 million to $4.34 million. Korean title “Special Delivery” earned $744,000 in third place, down from its $1.33 million opening a week earlier. After two weekends, it has accumulated $3.20 million. Another Korean-made hopeful, “The Policeman’s Lineage” held on to fourth place with $492,000 in its third weekend. Since releasing on Jan. 5, it has accumulated $5.43 million. A trio of international titles filled the next places. “The King’s Man” earned $171,000 for a cumulative score of $8.46 million. “The House of Gucci” fashioned a $170,000 score for a cumulative of 873,000 after 12 days. “West Side Story” played to $104,000 for a cumulative of $927,000 after 12 days. Neither local nor major Hollywood films were brought to market in the mid-January gloom. The weekend’s top new release was “Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City” in eighth place with a minimalist Friday-Sunday score of $80,200 earned from 259 screens and $153,000 over its opening five days. Another new release, Denmark’s “Another Round” landed in ninth spot with a $56,000 weekend and $96,000 over five days. A sign of possibly brighter things to come was the $56,000 haul by “ The Pirates: The Last Royal Treasure ” which played playing previews in just 14 venues ahead of a full release on Wednesday. The film is a sequel to Lotte Entertainment’s 2014 hit “The Pirates” which earned $55.7 million.", "image_url": null, "source_id": "variety" }, { "title": "الاتحاد التونسي: مصابي كورونا لم تظهر عليهم
